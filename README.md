<h2>Hey! This is Kun Jiang ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>
  ðŸ˜„I am a programming enthusiast from Hunan Province, China, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Engineering Mechanics in Changsha.
</p>
<p>
  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on crystal plasticity and doing some works about experiments and finite element simulation. So studying Python and Fortran language is necessary to me. Occasionally I also  write scripts to process experimental data or ABAQUS input files. I appreciate it very much if someone communicates that with me.
