### Hey! This is Kun Jiang ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„I'm a programming enthusiast from Hunan Province of China and studying in Changsha.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on crystal plasticity and doing some works about experiments and finite element simulation. So studying Python and Fortran language is necessary to me. Occasionally I also  write scripts to process experimental data or ABAQUS input files. I appreciate it very much if someone communicates that with me.
